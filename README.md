# EnhancedDiceApp-AndroidApp
The Enhanced Dice App allows the user to roll between 1 and 3 dice. They may roll them for 2000 milliseconds or cancel by hitting the x that replaces the roll action button. The user may also change the color of the dice by going to the colors page through the drop-down menu. This lets the user scroll a bar for red, green, and blue seeker bars. The screen also displayed the current color from the bars. There is an about page in the drop-down menu with some info about the app.
